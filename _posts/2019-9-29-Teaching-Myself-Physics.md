title: Teaching Myself Physics
author: Charles Thomas
---

I have come up a slightly bonkers plan (partially inspired by [this article](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics)). So here's a blogpost explaining what I'm doing and why I'm doing.

## Motivation
Having just finished high school, I was faced with them dilemma of what to do next: university or the world of work. I was fortunate enough to be offered a position as a Software Engineer at an awesome company and I'm having a blast. However, there is part of me that missess the mathmatics and physics that made up most of the last two years. So both to satisfy my curiosity and to decide if I might want to do a Physics degree in the future, I have decided to attempt to teach myself the contents of an undergraduate physics degree. 

## The Plan
My plan is heavily based on Susan Fowler's incredible [article](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics) but I will make a few modifications. 
Firstly, to dip my toe in the water I am going to start with Leonard Susskind's series [The Theoretical Minimum](https://theoreticalminimum.com/biography) for two primary reasons: I already own three of the books which I haven't read yet; and I believe doing so will give me a very high level overview of the subject which hopefully will give me an insight in whether I want to continue with my plan.
Assuming I decide to continue with my plan, I will be following reasonably closely with Susan's plan, however, at the time of writing I am planning to use Mathematical Methods For Physics And Engineering as my main textbook for the mathmatical component of the course - for the simple reason I already posess it. I may also skip some of the early content depending on how familar with it from my A Levels. 

##Â How can you help?
I would welcome any feedback on my idea, particulary from anyone with Physics or Mathematics background who has any ideas for resources or just general tips or advice.
