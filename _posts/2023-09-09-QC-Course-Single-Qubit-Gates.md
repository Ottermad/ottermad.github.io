title: Basic Quantum Computing - Single Qubit Systems

We're finally ready to start getting into some actual quantum computing. In our last post we introducted the qubit. This was a quantum state of the form:

$$a\ket{0} + b\ket{1}$$

We said that it evolves in time according to some unitary matrix U. 

In Quantum Computing, there is a the idea of a quantum gate, which acts on a qubit. Just like a regular logic gate acts on a classical bit. Now a quantum gate changes a quantum state so it must be represented by unitary matrix.

In this post, we'll take a look at couple of common gates that work on a single qubit.

## Pauli Matrices

## Hadamard Matrices
