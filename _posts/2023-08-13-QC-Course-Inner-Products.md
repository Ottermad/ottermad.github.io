## What is an inner product?
Last time, we talked about vector spaces and we said that they have two binary operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication.

We can add a third operation called an inner product to a vector space to turn it into an inner product space.

An inner product is a binary operation that takes in two vectors and gives us back a scalar. We usually represent it with a dot

$$\cdot : V \times V \rightarrow S$$

Or we write it with a set of angle brackets

$$\langle x, y \rangle$$


## Properties of an inner product

The inner product must obey 3 special properties

### Conjugate symmetry
What this means is if we reverse the order of an inner product, we just get the complex conjugate of the original out. So

$$\langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle}$$

In this case where the set of scalars we are working with is the real numbers, then since 

$$x = \overline{x}$$

We get  

$$\langle x, y \rangle = \langle y, x \rangle$$

* Linearity in the first argument

* Positive-definiteness 

## Geometry of an inner product
An inner product is often said to give geometry to a space. This is because it allows us to talk about the sizes of vectors and the angles between them
