* What is a linear combination?
We have talked about how in a vector space you can add vectors together and mutliply them together. These two operations allow us to talk about linear combinations of vectors 

Given two vectors v and w we know that

z = av + bw

Where a and b are scalars is also a vector. And we say that z is a linear combination of v and w. 

So a linear combination is just a combination of two (or more) vectors using only vector addition and scalar multiplication. 

Todo example 

* What is the span of a linear combination?
Given two vectors v and we we can ask what are all the vectors we can from them using linear combinations. The set of all vectors we can make from them is called the span. 

Todo examples 

We can even consider the span of more than two vectors in fact given a set of vectors we can ask what is the span of all the vectors in the set

Todo example 

* What is linear indepence? 
Given a set of a vectors P and a vector c we can ask if c is in the span of P 

If c is not in the span of P then we say c is linearly independent of P because we cannot write it as linear combination of the vectors in P. 

If c is in the span of P then we day it is linearly dependent. 


* linearly indepdent set 
Given a set of vectors we can ask if I take a vector out of the set is it linearly indepent to all the other vectors. 

If every vector in a set is linearly independent from every other vector in the set then we say that the set is linearly dependent 

* What is a basis?
Given a vector space we can ask is there a set of vectors such that they span the whole space. 

In other words can we make all the vectors in the vector space out of some smaller subet of the vectors. 

Todo example 

We can now impose another restriction on our set of vectors: that the set is linearly independent. 

If there is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans the whole space we call that set a basis
