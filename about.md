# About Me
I'm am an (aspiring) theoretical physicist with a broad range of interests including symmetries and geometry in physics and quantum computation. 

Currently, I am a studying my master's degree in [Mathematical and Theoretical Physics](https://mmathphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/home) at Oxford University. And before that I studied Mathematics and Philosophy at Durham University.

During my undergraduate degree, I also co-founded [Onfolk](https://www.onfolk.com/), a Payroll and HR start up, that was acquired by [Tide](https://www.tide.co/blog/tide-update/weve-acquired-onfolk/). While a part of Onfolk, we took part in [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) S21, raised our seed round and hire our early employees.

Before my degrees, I also worked as a software engineer at [Monzo](https://monzo.com/), helping to build a better bank.
