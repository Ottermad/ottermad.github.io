## Vector Space
A vector space is collection of two sets and two binary operations.

The first set we'll call V and is the set of vectors. It can be any set you want 

The second set we'll call set and is the set of scalars. This means it has to be either the set of real numbers or the complex numbers. (Technically it has to be a field but these are the two most common fields you'll come across).

The first operation we'll call addition and denote with a + sign. It takes two vectors (two members of our set V) and gives us back a third one.

Using the notation from the earlier post about maps:

$$ + : V \times V \rightarrow V$$

The second operation we'll call scalar multiplication and we'll denote it by *. It takes a one input from the set of scalars and another input from the set of vectors and gives us back a new vector.

$$ * : S \times V \rightarrow V$$

Now both + and * must have some special properties which we'll discuss below but first we'll look at some examples of vector spaces.
