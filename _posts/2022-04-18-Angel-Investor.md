title: What I look for as an angel investor?
author: Charles Thomas
---

Over the last year I've spent a lot of time thinking about start ups and watching them grow. One day, my co founder asked me what would I look for if I was angel investor. Sadly, I do not yet have the money to angel invest myself but it was an interesting thought experiment. I came the conclusion that if I was angel investor I would ask 4 questions.

## How are you planning to make money?
The first question I would ask a start up is: how are you planning to make money? For most start ups, the answer should  be charge the customer. If your customer isn't willing to pay for your product then either:
* the problem it solves isn't painful enough for that segment of customers
* your product doesn't solve the problem well enough

Even if you're planning to add a free tier it seems better to find the people who are willing to pay for it first. If they're willing to pay for it then the problem is probably much worse for them. This means they will give you better feedback. 

Charging customers also gives you a metric you can easily keep track of and is harder to delude yourself about.

While there are exceptions to this - especially if you're planning to monetise via ads - I think this is true for most start ups.

## Who is technical?
Secondly, I'd ask who is technical on the team? While it's possible for non technical founders to succeed, it helps if there is at least one person who build the product from the get go. This is because hiring is hard and engineers are expensive so being technical makes your life cheaper and easier. Also, the early days you should be building your product and talking to your users. If you can't build your product it's hard to do this.


## B2B or B2C?
My next question would be are you selling to businesses (B2B) or individuals (B2C)? There are successful companies in both camps but I would be more comfortable putting my money in B2B companies. Firstly, because I have more experience working in them. Secondly, there are couple of things that I think are easier in the B2B world. 

Firstly, customers expect to pay for products and you are able to get away with charging them more. As an individual, you have to provide quite a lot of value for me to give you £10 a month. This is much less so for products aimed at businesses. Secondly, business tends to have specific problems and therefore will give you much better feedback on why you're product doesn't work. Whereas a lot of consumers are much less opinionated.

## What are planning to spend it on?
Finally, I would ask what are you planning to spend the money on? Hiring fast is a pretty good way to die fast for a lot of companies. That said you will probably need hire some people. Therefore understanding how many people a company is going to hire and why, would give me a good insight to how the founders are thinking.


## Summary
Overall, this is not say that companies who have different answers to these questions can't succeed. In fact no one really predict which companies are going to be successful. But the answers to these questions would give me the confidence to put my money where my mouth is.

- How are you planning to make money?
Charge for it! You probably can
Otherwise ads, partnerships?
Fremimium - start with the premium tier
Revenue gives you a goal

- Who is technical?
Preferbale 1+ technical founder 
Non technical foudners can succeed but
Engineers are expensive

B2B 
- Easier to charge
- Gives better feedback
- Can be harder to sell to 
- Maybe superhuman

What are you planning on?
- Don't overhire
- People are your biggest cost
- They add a communication overhead
