# About Me
I'm am an (aspiring) theoretical physicist with a broad range of interests including symmetries and geometry in physics and quantum computation. 

Currently, I am a studying my master's degree in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics at Oxford University. And before that I studied Mathematics and Philosophy at Durham University.

During my undergraduate degree, I also co-founded Onfolk, a Payroll and HR start up, that was acquired by Tide. While a part of Onfolk, we took part in YCombinator S21, raised our seed round and hire our early employees.

Before my degrees, I also worked as a software engineer at Monzo, helping to build a better bank.
