## What is a linear map?

Let f be a map between two vector spaces

If 

$$f(av + bw) = f(av) + f(bw)$$

where v,w are vectors and a and b are scalars then f is a linear map

## Linear maps are completely determined by its action on the basis

Let f be a linear map

Let V has the following basis

$$\{b_1, b_2, ...., b_n\}$$

$$f(v) = f(\sum_i^n a_i b_i)$$

$$= \sum_i^nf( a_i b_i)$$

$$= \sum_i^na_i f(b_i)$$

So if we know what f does to each basis vector then we know what is does to any vector

So let's write f in the following way:

$$[f(b_1) f(b_2) f(b_3) ... f(b_n)]$$

So here's an example

$$[f(b_1) f(b_2)] = [3 5]$$

So 

$f()
