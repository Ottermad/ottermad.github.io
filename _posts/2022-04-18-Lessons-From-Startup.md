- Got to sell
- Get some one using and paying for it

- Part of PMF is also distribution

Charge for it
- If the problem is painful enough people will pay
- Gives you a great metric
- If people won't pay then product isn't good enough or the wrong customers

Co founder relationships matter
- They will help you get through it
- Overcommuniate
- Strong manning
- brain dumping

It is really hard
- It is emotionally hard
- Easy to forogot the wins
- Constants criticisms 
- You see all the bugs
- Everything hurts more when it's yours

Early hiring is hard
- Try to go for people you know
- Don't overhire

Fundraising
- ABC plan
- Be willing to walk away
- Easier if you don't need the money

Accountability is great
- Best thing about YC
- Strart up school/ YT gives you the advice
- You need to follow it
- It's hard to follow advice
- You're special and you're not

Most decisions seem bigger than they are

Get used to saying no
