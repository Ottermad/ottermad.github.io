# What is a set?

A set is a collection of objects. We denote a set by putting the list of objects in curly brackets. Here are some examples

$${1, 2, 4}$$, $${cat, dog, bird}$$, $${a, b, c}$$

Two sets are the same when they contain exactly the same objects.

There are two basic ways of combining sets to make sets out of existing sets.

Firstly, we can take the union of two sets (denoted by the symbol $$\cup$$). The union of two sets is a set with all the elements from either set. For example: $
