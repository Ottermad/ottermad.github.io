## What is a set?
A set is a collection of objects. We denote a set by putting the list of objects in curly brackets. Here are some examples

$$\{1, 2, 4\}, \{cat, dog, bird\}, \{a, b, c\}$$

Note that sets do not have duplicate items

Two sets are the same when they contain exactly the same objects. 

## Combining Sets
There are two basic ways of combining sets to make sets out of existing sets.

Firstly, we can take the union of two sets. This is denoted by the symbol:
$$\cup$$. 

The union of two sets is a set with all the elements from either set. For example: 

$$\{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{4, 5, 6\} = \{1, 2, 3,4, 5,6\}$$

If an element is in both sets when we take the union that element only appears once because sets do not have duplicate items 

$$\{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{3, 4, 5,\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$ 

The second way of combining sets is the intersection, denoted by

$$\cap$$

The intersection of two sets is a set containing only the elements that were in both sets. For example:

$$\{1, 2, 3\} \cap \{3, 4, 5\} = \{3\}$$ 


## Subsets
Suppose we have two sets called A and B. If all the elements of set A are in set B then we say A is a subset of B and we write:

$$A \subseteq B$$

If A is a subset of B and A is not the same as B e.g. B has at least one element that is not in A then we say A is a strict subset of B and we write

$$A \subset B$$

## Sizes of sets
The size of a set of is called its cardinality. For finite sets it is just the number of elements in in that set. For infinite sets it gets more complicated but that's a topic for another post.

We denote the size of a set with pipes e.g.

$$|\{a, b, c\}| = 3$$

## Useful sets to know
The empty set is the set with no elements in it. It is often denoted:

$$\varnothing$$

The natural numbers are the set of positive whole numbers (some authors choose to include 0, others do not). It is denoted:

$$\mathbb{N}$$

The integers are the set of whole numbers, denoted:

$$\mathbb{Z}$$

Finally, the real numbers are all the numbers we usually think of including irrational numbers like pi. We denote it:

$$\mathbb{R}$$
