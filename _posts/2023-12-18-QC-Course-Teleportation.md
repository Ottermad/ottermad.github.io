title: Basic Quantum Computing - Teleportation
author: Charles Thomas
---

In super dense coding, we used a qubit to send 2 bits of classical information, quantum teleportation is a way of using classical bits to send a qubit.

Once again, we have Alice and Bob, they meet up and create a pair of qubits in the entangled state:

$$\frac{\ket{00} + \ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}}$$

They then go their seperate ways with one qubit each.

Once day, Alice wants to send a qubit to Bob.
