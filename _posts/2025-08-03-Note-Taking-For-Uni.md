title: Note taking for Mathematics at University
author: Charles Thomas
---

I have been doing a lot of tutoring recently, and a student of mine asked about how I took notes during university so I thought I would share how I took notes for my mathematics class in both my undergraduate degree and my master's.

# Lectures
For my in-person lectures, I took notes on my tablet (I used a [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com/)) and I copied nearly everything down, as it helped me pay attention. After the lecture, I then type up my lecture notes using LaTeX and [Overleaf](overleaf.com). I found this particularly helpful because often in lectures I didn't feel that I had fully understood some of the proofs, but going back over them when typing them up really helped me get to grips with them.

I know some people who don't take notes but instead just focus on what the lecturer is saying and go through it afterwards. I think
this could also work well if you can genuinely focus without writing.

# Lecture Notes
Most maths courses at university provide lecture notes. I didn't read them before the lectures, but when I was typing up my handwritten notes, I would read through the official lecture notes and add details from them to my typed notes. I found this useful as sometimes a proof might not be done in a lecture, but is done in the lecture notes.

# Problem Sets
During my undergrad, I did the problem sets but I didn't make any notes from them. However, during my master's, I noticed that the problem sets tended to include more useful results that you might need later, so in hindsight I would have gone through the problem sheet and updated my typed notes with any results from them that aren't in the notes.

# Books
Textbooks can be useful extra resources when studying a maths course. Particularly in the 3rd year of my undergrad, I would read a section of a relevant textbook around the same time as I was typing up my notes for a lecture. I often didn't add anything to my lecture notes from the text, but I did find it useful seeing the same content presented in a different way.

During my master's, I found that the lecture notes were less detailed so in hindsight, I probably would have added details from the textbook to my typed notes as well.
