- I quite like writing

- Why?

- http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html It helps me to really understand what I'm thinking, brain is constantly busy, writing forces me to sit down and really process what's going on up there

- It's important. Communication is really important. I spent a lot of time coming with ideas/solutions then trying to explain them to others. Therefore I want to get better at it.

- It keeps a record of what I was thinking/understanding. Particularly with technical things it gives me a handy references I can look it.

- Writing Challenge: 1 post a week for 8 weeks
