What I look for as an angel investor?

- How are you planning to make money?
Charge for it! You probably can
Otherwise ads, partnerships?
Fremimium - start with the premium tier
Revenue gives you a goal

- Who is technical?
Preferbale 1+ technical founder 
Non technical foudners can succeed but
Engineers are expensive

B2B 
- Easier to charge
- Gives better feedback
- Can be harder to sell to 
- Maybe superhuman

What are you planning on?
- Don't overhire
- People are your biggest cost
- They add a communication overhead
