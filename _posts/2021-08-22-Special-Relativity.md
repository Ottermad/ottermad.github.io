# Special Relativity for Philosophers

In 1905, Einstein had a remarkable year in which he published 4 papers all of which made major contributions to physics. One of the papers was called "On the electrodynamics of moving bodies" and in this paper he laid out a theory known as Special Relativity. This theory has a couple of odd consequences that are interesting to both philosophers and physicists. The first one is called length contraction: things change length as they move. The other is called time dilation: time flows at a different rates depending on how fast you're moving. I am going to walk you through the basics of this theory and why it is interesting to philosophers. 

Special relativity starts with two rules: 
* Light (in a vacuum) travels at a fixed speed, c, for all observers
* The laws of physics should be the same in all frames of reference

## Lights travels at a fixed speed
This first rule is straightforward: if I measure the speed of light in a vacuum, no matter where I am in the universe, I will get the same answer: 3x10^9ms^-1

At first glance this doesn't seem too odd; so to understand why this rule is important consider this example. Imagine a man standing on a train and another man on the platform. At first the train and the men aren't moving so if the man on the train throws a ball at a speed 2ms^-1 then both men will measure the speed of the ball to be 2ms^-1. 

But know imagine that the train is moving. When the man on the train throws the ball he'll measure the speed to be 2ms^-1. But to the man on the platform the ball will be moving much faster. In fact it will be moving at the speed of the train plus 2ms^-1. 

This shouldn't be particularly surprising if you've ever thrown something out of moving car. The object will go a lot faster than if you'd be standing still.

However, this is not the case with light. If the man on the train had a torch instead of a ball and turned the light on then both men would have measured the beam of light as moving at the same speed even if the train was moving.

## The laws of physics are the same in all frames of reference
This statement can be a little harder to understand. 


## Deriving time dilation
* You are at rest at (0,0)
* 3 people: A, B, C
* All separated at equal distances and walking at equal speed

* As person A walks past you he sends out a light signal to person B at (0,0)
* Person B receives the signal at (x1, t1)
* Person B also receives a signal at (x1, t1) from person C
* Since light travels at the same speed they must have been equal distances from person B

Find the co-ordinates at which person C sent out the light ray

First find when person B receives the light signals
* Light travels at speed c so has equation x = ct
* Person B has equation x = vt + 1
* ct = vt + 1 => (c-v)t=1 => t = 1/(c-v)
* x = c/(c-v)

Now find when person C sent out light signal but is going the other way:

* Light travels at speed c so x = -ct + A
* -ct + A = c/(c-v)
* -c(c-v) + A = c/(c-v)
* A = (2c)/(c-v)
* x = vt + 2 & x = -ct + (2c)/(c-v)
* vt + 2 = -ct + (2c)/(c-v)
* (v+c)t+2 = (2c)(c-v) 
* (v+c)t = (2c)(c-v) -2
* t = (-2c)-2/(v+c)
