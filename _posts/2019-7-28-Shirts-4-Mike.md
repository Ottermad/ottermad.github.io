## Shirts 4 Mike
One of my favourite resources for learning to program has been [Team Treehouse](teamtreehouse.com). They had a tutorial for learning PHP that taught you by building a website called Shirts 4 Mike - a fictional website selling t-shirts. 

As I was learning Python and Flask (a web framework for Python) I recreated the website using Python. I then deployed it on Heroku and can be seen [here](http://murmuring-escarpment-5572.herokuapp.com/). The code can be found at this [repo](https://github.com/Ottermad/Python-Flask-Store). It features a fully functioning e-commerce system using Paypal and a working contact form making use of Sendgrid.
