I've always enjoyed writing. That's why I started this blog. As a little kid, I used to write stories and songs (although I did get put off the whole thing for a while during high school). Recently, I've been thinking about why I like writing. 

Paul Graham wrote an essay called [Putting Ideas into Words](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html) which captures one of the reasons I like writing: it organises my thoughts. My brain feels like a pretty busy place - thoughts constantly jostling and bumping into one another. Writing lets me structure them and flesh them out. This means I understand them better. It also means I can talk about them more clearly.

It is particularly useful when I'm learning something. Specifically it does two things. It forces me to make notes that coherent and useful rather than random scribbles. This means I have to understand what I've been learning. Secondly, it also gives me a more concrete goal when I'm trying to learn something. This is why I have been posting some on Quantum Computing.

It also allows me to keep a record of my thinking. This is useful for technical subjects because it gives me a good reference when I've forgotten. It's also interesting to look back and see what my thinking was even a few short months ago.


Writing is also really important. It's one of the main ways we communicate with people and communication really matters. Most of designing software boils down to communicating. You have to communicate with customers to understand the problem. Communicate with regulators to understand the constraints. Communicate with other engineers to divide up the work. It goes on. 

Since it is so important, I want to get better at it. To get better at anything I have to practice it. That's why I am setting myself the goal of writing one blog post a week for the next 8 weeks. I'm not holding myself to one topic although my ideas at the moment revolve around start ups, quantum computing and coffee.


- I quite like writing

- Why?

- http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html It helps me to really understand what I'm thinking, brain is constantly busy, writing forces me to sit down and really process what's going on up there

- It's important. Communication is really important. I spent a lot of time coming with ideas/solutions then trying to explain them to others. Therefore I want to get better at it.

- It keeps a record of what I was thinking/understanding. Particularly with technical things it gives me a handy references I can look it.

- Writing Challenge: 1 post a week for 8 weeks
